# General approach to DailyProgrammer problems

#### Input handling function: Function dealing with the input and the formatting of the input into what we want to deal with.

#### Core solving function: Function dealing with the solving of the problem.

#### Output rendering function: Function that applies the Core solving function onto the Input handling function.

# Broad Strokes golden rule of programming

#### The most important thing in any problem is Types.

#### The details of the function are not important, the top priority is to make sure the input Type(s) and the Output Type is correct.

#### Once the Types have been correctly defined, the function must adhere to these Types. If they do not, there is a problem with the function. 

#### DO NOT change the input/output types, change the FUNCTION so that it adheres.
