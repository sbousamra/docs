* First day of work, set up workspace environment
* Looked through cammy-web repository to try understand the code
* Introduced to yarn, react-stamp and electron. Yarn helps to make sure that the dependencies downloaded are always the same between users to avoid bugs. React-stamp allows the ability to compose parts of separate components if wanted. Electron is used to turn your web-app into a desktop app without having to change the code too much.

* Added ability to add post 'tweets' on twitterClone project. Saves tweets on database, displays them in the same column just like twitter.
* Fixed webpack to proxy server to dev server, saving me the hassel of rebuilding on every change on client side.

# 05/09/2017

* Read up on promises and started thinking of them in terms of types
* Daily Programmer 145 finished
* Had a quick look at mocha docs

# 04/09/2017

* Changed the formatting of STANDUP.md to 'today' and 'yesterday' to signify what I did yesterday and what I 'hope' to do today.
* Did more reading on 'callbacks' and 'promises'
* Cleaned up repositories, making sure a README.md is added to each, make sure repos names correctly depict what the repos is about and remove dunnecessary directories and/or files.
* Implemented redirect fix for twitterClone on going from signup => home.
* Finished off SQL migration from var databasing in twitterClone.

* Did Daily Programmers 139/267/293 successfully.
* Did work with Dom with node using the standard 'fs' library and 'bluebird' promise library to learn about creating promises. When handling promises using 'then' and 'catch', we're producing side-effects of the result, but we can never just take the value out of the promise, as it could potentially return different 'types' of values (i.e. an expected result or an error).

# 02/09/2017

* Moved DIARY.md to docs
* Altered Daily Programmer 329 to use filter than creating my own implementation of it (less code), as well as foreach rather than map. Approach is commented also to show what is happening in the code.
* Links to Daily Programmer added to each DP as a comment.

# 01/09/2017

* Read up on basics of JS from a few blogs
* Did Daily Programmer 329
