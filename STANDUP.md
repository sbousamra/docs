# 02/09/2017

## Yesterday

* Read up on basics of JS from a few blogs
* Did Daily Programmer 329

## Today

* Move DIARY.md to docs as STANDUP.md.
* Alter Daily Programmer 329 to use filter than creating my own implementation of it (less code), as well as foreach rather than map. Approach is commented also to show what is happening in the code.
* Links to Daily Programmer added to each DP as a comment.

# 03/09/2017

## Yesterday

* Renamed DIARY.md to STANDUP.md, also fixed dp 329 as I wanted to.

## Today

* Do reading on 'promises' and 'callbacks' to solidify understanding.

## Yesterday

* Did Daily Programmers 139/267/293 successfully.
* Did work with Dom with node using the standard 'fs' library and 'bluebird' promise library to learn about creating promises. When handling promises using 'then' and 'catch', we're producing side-effects of the result, but we can never just take the value out of the promise, as it could potentially return different 'types' of values (i.e. an expected result or an error).

## Today

* Change the formatting of STANDUP.md to 'today' and 'yesterday' to signify what I did yesterday and what I 'hope' to do today.
* Do more reading on 'callbacks' and 'promises'
* Do a daily programmer
* Clean up repositories, making sure a README.md is added to each, make sure repos names correctly depict what the repos is about and remove unnecessary directories and/or files.
