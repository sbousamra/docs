. What is the difference between a primitive string a string object?

. function sayHi() { 
  if(true) { 
    var s = "hi"; 
  } 
  alert(s); // alert("hi") -- `s` is still within scope. }

  Why is that 's' is still available to anything outside the curly braces within the function? The variable is shifted to the top and is run first, but what if I don't want it to be available to the whole function?

. This also means that if you refer to a variable outside the scope of your function, youâ€™ll use the value of that variable at the moment the code is run, not at the moment your function is created. This trips up beginners all the time:

 var thingsToDo = [];
 for(var i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
   thingsToDo.push(function() {alert('hello ' + i);}); 
 }
 for(var k in thingsToDo) {
   thingsToDo[k]();               // alerts "hello 2" twice.
 }

 What is even going on here?

 . ECMAScript 6 will introduce a let keyword, which will allow you to declare a variable scoped to the curly-braces. This is known as Lexical Scoping.
